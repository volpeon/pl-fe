`pl-fe` is a social networking client app. It works with any Mastodon API-compatible software, but it's focused on supporting alternative backends, like Pleroma or GoToSocial.

## Goals

- **Feature-rich**: `pl-fe` includes a wide range of features, such as a WYSIWYG text editor, draft posts, and more.
- **Compatibility**: `pl-fe` is compatible with any Mastodon API-compatible software, treating alternative backends as first-class citizens. Chats, emoji reactions, groups, interaction policies? We support them all. Thanks to `pl-api`, which provides a unified interface for interacting with Mastodon API-compatible servers, implementation differences do not affect the user experience.
- **Unopinionated**: `pl-fe` doesn't impose any arbitrary limitations on the user. We do not specify a limit of reactions you can use on a single post and try to implement every feature available in the API.
- **Stay private**: `pl-fe` includes features which help you maintain online privacy. This includes URL cleaning, which helps you remove unwanted parts of URLs used to mark your online activity.

## Try it out

Want to test `pl-fe` with **any existing MastoAPI-compatible server?** Try [pl.mkljczk.pl](https://pl.mkljczk.pl) — enter your server's domain name to use `pl-fe` on any server!

If you want to use `pl-fe` as the default frontend on your server, download the latest build from [pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-fe.zip](http://pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-fe.zip) and install it following the instructions for your backend. For example, on a standard Pleroma installation you can use:

```sh
curl -O https://pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-fe.zip
unzip pl-fe.zip -d /opt/pleroma/instance/static/
rm pl-fe.zip
```

## Repository

The repository hosts `pl-fe`, but also libraries related to the project. This includes:

- [pl-fe](./packages/pl-fe/) itself — a social networking client app
- [pl-api](./packages/pl-api) — a library for interacting with Mastodon API-compatible servers, focused on support for projects extending the official Mastodon API. It is used by `pl-fe`.
- [pl-hooks](./packages/pl-hooks) — a library including hooks for integrating with Mastodon API, based on `pl-api` and TanStack Query. It is intended to be used within `pl-fe`. Work  in progress.

More projects to be announced.

## FAQ / Common misconceptions

### What does the project name mean?

I named the project after my now-deprecated personal fork of Pleroma, called simply `pl`. They were meant to be recommended together. However, `pl-fe` evolved into something more serious than a little fork. This is a bad and confusing name, but I don't really care about branding.

> For a maintained fork of Pleroma focused on `pl-fe` compatibility, check out my new project, [Nicolex](https://codeberg.org/mkljczk/nicolex).

I will bite people calling `pl-fe` *Polish front-end* or *Polish Soapbox*. And I don't mean sending them the [`Bite` activity](https://ns.mia.jetzt/as/) (which works in pl-fe on supported backends btw).

## License

`pl-fe` is a fork of [Soapbox](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/soapbox/) and inherits a lot of code from [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/).
