# Changelog

## Unreleased

Changes made since the project forked from Soapbox in April 2024.

### Major changes

- Switched to a separate library [`pl-api`](https://codeberg.org/mkljczk/pl-fe/src/branch/develop/packages/pl-api) for Mastodon API integration. It is mostly written from scratch, inheriting minor code parts from Soapbox/Mastodon. This also comes with improved compatibility with various Mastodon API extensions and abstracts out the implementation details.
